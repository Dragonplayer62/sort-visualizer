# Sorting visualizer

This is a visualizer for sorting algorithms made with Svelte, Sveltekit and Tailwind.

I made this to learn webdev, so don't have high expectations.

Currently only Bubblesort is implemented.

For the webscraper, I programmed my own [web-scraper](https://github.com/Dragonplayer62/web-scraper) and fetch from it
